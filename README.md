# Bootcamp-Ratings
This is a repository that will be used to design a command line application that is used to give rating on the EPIC values alignment of Boot-camp candidates during Boot-camp.

## Features

### Users:
Users come in 3 roles. Bootcampers, LFAs and LFs: 
* Bootcampers are scored daily on all our EPIC values based on their outputs and observed interactions with their teams.    The scores ranges between -2 to 2 i.e (Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Very Satisfied)
* LFs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates in Bootcamp. They however can’t change any of the scores and    neither can they add scores.
* LFAs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates that are assigned to them during Bootcamp, add scores for      them and edit only their candidate’s scores.
* Bootcampers can only see the scores they have been given.
